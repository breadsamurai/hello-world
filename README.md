a paranoid programming beginner's space.

It is now 12.12 A.M., 5/30/17. It's officially the RICE DUMPLING FESTIVAL! :)that's a joke...
RICE DUMPLING FESTIVAL has it's real name of DuanWu Festival (i mean in pure Chinese Pingying it's called DuanWu,
trying to translate it as LiftNoon, lol). It is a tranditional Chinese festival (really old!) that commemorates
a historical patriotic figure named QuYuan. There's actually a long story behind that and i do not intend to type
them all here!(it is late i need to get my sleep)
Anyways i wish all who celebrate this festival enjoy your day.
